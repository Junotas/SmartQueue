hello world


I had an idea to make a project that handles customer service with LLM intergration

the idea came from the fact that it seems alot of companies want to replace customer service employees with LLM solutions
but my thought with this project is to make a tool (with LLM intergration) for customer service employees to make their jobs easier

basic use case would be a user write a complaint, and are then put in a queue to talk to a customer service employee. 

the complaint is summarized by ai and this summary is then put in a queue for the customer service employee

the employee, after terminating there previous chat, gets the summary before entering the new chat and a suggestion on how to proceed with helping the user on the other end on the chat, the employee then enters the chat more prepared

this is the plan that I'm starting the project with
